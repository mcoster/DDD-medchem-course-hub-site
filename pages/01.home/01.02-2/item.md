Please watch the videos linked in this post. They summarise the use of Combinatorial Chemistry (CombiChem) and Parallel Synthesis techniques in Drug Discovery.

The most important parts of this video are between 11:47 and 17:18, although it is all relevant to this course. While you watch it, think about the following:
_**What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of CombiChem vs. Parallel Synthesis**_

In what situations do you think you could use each of these techniques?

This video may look quite old-fashioned! Nevertheless, it gives some good insights into the use of CombiChem in industry.
_**What are some 'barriers to entry' in the use of CombiChem techniques?**_

Since its early applications to drug discovery, CombiChem techniques have been applied to many other areas of chemistry research - _can you propose any areas that might benefit from this approach?_
