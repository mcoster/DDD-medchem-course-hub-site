The major sub-topic of Cycle 3 is Synthesis in *Lead Optimisation*. This video shows some of the challenges faced by medicinal chemists as they undertake Lead Optimisation. Please watch from 13:12 to ~ 24:51, and think about the following questions:
1. What is _Ligand Efficiency (LE)_?
2. What is _Lipophilic Ligand Efficiency (LLE)_?
3. Why do we care about these numbers in drug design?
